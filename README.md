# Rapid
This is a github repository for RAPID, a tool with neuro-symbolic learning method. Rapid combines pre-trained CV models and inductive logic learning to infer logic-based labeling rules with a small amount of labeled data.

## Installation
You should follow the instruction (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and activate it. Here we provide an example on Windows:
1. Go to your 3.10 base
2. Create the virtual environment (the env just for example, you can change it to the name you like)   
```
python -m venv env
```
3. Activate
```
.\env\Scripts\Activate
```
After you get the virtual environment, you can install our requirment.txt (mainly for Active Learning module)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Done!
